    Real-time async API over Phoenix Channels. Covers collaborative document
    editing via Yjs CRDT and server-push BEAM/host telemetry metrics via OTLP JSON.

    Documents are synchronized via binary Yjs protocol messages over WebSocket.
    Telemetry metrics are pushed as OTLP JSON payloads at fixed intervals.
