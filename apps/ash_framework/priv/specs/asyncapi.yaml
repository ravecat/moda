        Encoding uses varUint message prefixes (not JSON arrays):
        - Top-level `0` => sync protocol message
        - Top-level `1` => awareness protocol update
        - Top-level `3` => awareness query
        For sync messages, nested sync subtypes are:
        - `0` => sync step 1
        - `1` => sync step 2
        - `2` => update
        See https://github.com/yjs/y-protocols for encoding details.
